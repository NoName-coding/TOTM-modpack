AE2 stuff           since lazy AE2 does the exact same job but better
Avartia addons      completly useless since we have extended crafting
bountifull          could be usefull in vanilla , but not here 
player revive       if i don't find a way to tweak it so people don't abuse it ,(i'm looking at you Paul)
